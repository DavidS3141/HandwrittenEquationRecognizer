	\section{Proposed method}
		The method used in this project for identifiing the symbols is the hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm. Using the functions provided in the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox from Matlab the implementation is straight forward: the image is converted into a data array containing the 2D coordinates of the occupied pixels in the image. Then the cluster tree is build using the euclidean distance and single linkage as the cluster distance. Based on the generated dendrogram a specified number of clusters can be derived. To provide an output for the following processing steps the bounding box of each recognized symbol is returned.
	
	\section{Analysis}
		The advantage of the hierarchical agglomerative clustering compared to other clustering methods is that it is independent of the initialization. As the assumption of the proposed method is that a symbol is defined as a connected space in the image space, the single linkage method is the most suited way to identify these symbols. The difficulties regarding symbols that are not connected in space (e.g. equal sign) can be solved by weighting vertical pixel space less than horizontal pixel space. 
		So an obvious disadvantage is, that connected symbols in some handwritings are recognized as one single symbol. Another problem is to define the number of symbols inside a picture. Identifiing the right point in the dendrogram is not trivial, as the horizontal pixel distance between the connection of two symbols and inside the symbol itself is the same.
